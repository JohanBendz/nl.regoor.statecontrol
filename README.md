# State Control app for Homey

The State Control app for Homey enables you to keep track of states in your home. For example, you can keep track of a home state (at home, away or sleeping), or the state of your lights in each room (off, switched manually, or switched by a motion sensor).
The goal of the app is to have a more structured method where multiple flows will manage devices.
